# Matrix Search


## Challenge Description:

You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of distinct integers and a target integer. Each row in the matrix is sorted, and each column is also sorted; the matrix doesn't necessarily have the same height and width.
Write a function that returns an array of the row and column indices of the target integer if it's contained in the matrix, otherwise [-1, -1].
