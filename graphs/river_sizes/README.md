# River sizes


## Challenge Description:


You're given a two-dimensional array (a matrix) of potentially unequal height and width containing only 0s and 1s. Each 0 represents land, and each 1 represents part of a river. A river consists of any number of 1s that are either horizontally or vertically adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent).
The number of adjacent 1s forming a river determine its size.

Note that a river can twist. In other words, it doesn't have to be a straight vertical line or a straight horizontal line; it can be L-shaped, for example.

Write a function that returns an array of the sizes of all rivers represented in the input matrix. The sizes don't need to be in any particular order.
